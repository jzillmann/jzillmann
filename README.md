Fell in ❤️ with crafting visual tools 🎬.
My current ⚔️ of choice are [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
I'm blessed and cursed with too many ideas. *More then i can ever do alone...* So reach out if you find any of my stuff interesting!
