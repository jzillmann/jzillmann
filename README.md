Fell in ‚ù§Ô∏è with crafting visual tools üé¨.
Current ‚öîÔ∏è of choice are [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
I'm blessed and cursed with too many ideas. *More then i can ever do alone...* So reach out if you find any of my stuff interesting!

### On my list

- **Spanish Notebook**: I'm learning spanish right now. There's a lot of great tools out there, what i'm missing is a digital notebook where i can write down my learnings in a structured way. Where writing it down is part of the learning... Already have some code in a private repo.
